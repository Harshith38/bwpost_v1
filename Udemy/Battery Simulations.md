### why  do we use Li-ion Battery?
Their are surly many types of battery like Nickel Cadmium, Nickel Metal- Hydride(NiMH), sealed Lead Acid and Li-ion batteries.
	- Li-ion is perred because of its high cycle life, voltage per cell 3.4 V to 1.5 V when compared to other cells.
	- Memory effect which sets the highest possible storage depending on the user usage(mobile charging 10 - 60%) this is low in litium batteries. 
	- these require less Maintance.
	- Negatives:- requires high safety. sensitive to temperature and damage.
	- 


Battery is made of ANODE -, Cathode+, seperator.

Litium ions move from higher concentrations to lower concentration(internally), if we connect a wire (externally), electrons move which is a electricity. When charging it is reversed

### Battery Terminology:
1. *State of Charge (SoC %)*: Ratio of Remaing Capacity(AmpH) to Rated capacity.
2. *State of Health (SoH %)*: Ratio of current usable capacity to Rated Capacity. 
3. *Remaining Useful Life (RUL - Cycles)*: This is the Remaining excepted life from a battery.
4. *Crate* : This is maximum Current that can be discharged and  Charged with Safe operating limits. Crate = Max Current/ Capacity. if the battery is rated as 200amH and you take 400amH then it is "2 Crate", which is rated by the supplier.
5. *Depth of Discharge (DoD %)*: Ratio of Capacity utilised to the Rated Capacity. DoD = 1 -SoC. it is how much is used.. if you control DoD it has a direct impact on health of battery life.
6. *Self Dicharge* : when battery is idle, due to internal reactions it discharges and losses capacity. 
7. Calender Life: When battery is stored for a very long period without usage, this reduces the capacity of the battery by Self Discharge. Hence, reducing life.
8. Internal Resistance : it is within battery. it is non linear depends on Temperature, SoC, Chemistry... 
9. Specific Energy Density: Energy per Mass of the Cell. SD = Kwh/Kg
10. Volumetric Density : Energy per Volume of the cell. VD = Kwh/L
11. Open Circuit Voltage: OCV, The Voltage across terminal at 0 current. when the battery is not used. measured using a voltmeter.
12. Nominal Voltage : The voltage of the battery at its equilibrium state.
