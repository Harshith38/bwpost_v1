# How to take smart notes

**Multitasking is not a good idea**
Writing is not just typing with a keyboard in to the computer but instead it means reading, comprehensing the papers, understanding the ideas, getting ideas, comparing thoughts, making connections, and finding the right words, structuring, editing, and rewriting.


**9.3 Give Each task the right kind of Attention**
accepting criticism is constructive only when all the writing is done, not when the your are forming the idea in the first stages of writing. let the ideas flow, dont critic here, when you are doing the writing then you can start to critic on the passage upon the wording, ideas, use of structure etc., Get your thoughts on the paper first.

Dont makes plans to write, which is equivalent to driving on rails, you cannot change the directions flexibliy. This makes you rigid in terms of organisation. 

9.4 Become an expert: Making plans is like a linear, multistep approach, which is never realistic in the first place, on the contrary being flexible is what essential in acedemic wirting which requuires lot of cognition decision making. we never know when that breakthrough idea could come in. It is like an art, something that only gets better with practice.

The author states that asking your teaching adivce on writing is not the best option, like the paramedics example, where the teaches knowledege could get you 3 out of 5 score where as the expert has a 4 or maybe 5, but to get that level you need to have that teeachers knowledge. which then builds up the intution. 
The feedback loop are the reason that makes the expert.

Facts that donot have a meaning or understood cannot hold in memory just like the memorising task in the example on rule and year. So asking better questions like could not only incearese our understanding but also facilitate our thinking:
1. How does this fact fit into my idea of...?
2. How can this phenomenon be explained by that theorey? 
3. Are these two ideas complement or contradict each other?
4. isn't this arguement is similar to that one?
5. Haven't i heard this before?
6. And above all: What does x mean for y?
