# Question IN CFD and FEM

- What are initial conditions?



- What are boundary conditions?





- Why do we mesh a part and what is exactly going on in the solving of the problem?



- How can you correctly define a solver in the CFD and Fem domain?

- What is prism layer mesh?
	Prism layer is so-called because ofÂ **the method of projecting the mesh faces from the core mesh onto the solid boundary, resulting in prism shaped cells**. There are various names but a general way to refer to them would be "near wall cells" or "cells next to walls."
