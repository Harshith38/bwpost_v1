# Huberman on muscle Hypotrophy




Good morninig Sai, It is really a wounderful talk by Andrew Huberman in his podcast. The talk is mainly going in to a deep dive of the two most aspects of the human health. One is Hypotrophy and other is endurance and strength.

Hypotrophy is a fancy name for muscle growth or muscle building. Endurance is the ability to sustain a hard workout longer lets say 30 min no breaks. Power is the function of strength and speed. 

Before going into detail lets discuss about the most common goals of the individual human being. One goal is become strong and build muscle, other one could be strength. It might seem that both the goals are the same but they are not. The perfect analogy could be a body builder and power lifter. The former are more bulky than the latter but less strong. Neverthless stronger than the average human like you and me definetly. The point is to have a clear goal in mind before diving in to the fitness regime. My goal is the strong and muscle building.

Now that you have your goal decided, lets see what are the training plans that are suggested by the expects in this podcast discuss. 

**Strength and hypotrophy:**

- you need to have a Progressive training:
	- Weights
	- reps
	- complexity
	- training days

- Modifiable variables
	- Exercise choice-- (Goblet squat less risk than squat) *The exercise choice doesnot get you the results it is the execution that does,* the technique the form that matters. ***FOCUS ON MOVING CORRECTLY***. the right way of doing the squat. 
	- one rep max
	- Intensity
	- Volume-- 5-30 reps per set 
	- Rest
- **Soreness** is not the metric for the exercise, that means you can train the same muscle every single day. if you are sore on the scale of 1-10 in 3 then you can train it.
- Frequency is important, idealy 1-3-5 day of training is best. i.e., trian shoulder today and rest for 48-72 hrs and train the muscle again.

Hypotrophy--> Volume(5-30reps)--> more sore --> 48-72hr rest
	- 2 times per week 3 muscle per session is great
	- Check your protein synthesis and recovery
	- Mechanical tension-- you have to feel the muscle contract during work, pump after work, and sore after work out.
	- muscular damage
	- metabolic stress
Strength --> Intensity(20Min HIT)--> less sore --> can train every day.
	-> 3-5 exercises -->3-5 reps -->3-5 sets --> 3-5 times/week (20Min)
	Eccentric movements like the pull up with wide arms. 

1. *To Get stronger what are the modifiable variables?*
	- all Joint and all range of motions.
	- Full snatch- all body movements(Perpendicular to the body like the bench press, shoulder press etc)

2. *How the exercise should be?*
	- It should have a warm up with 10 reps at 50% max weight, 8reps at 60%, 8reps at 70%, it should increase like this not a 80% max weight in the first set.
	- rest interval 2-4 mins

3. *How to breathe during the work out and after?*
	- Should have breathing routines between sets
	- double exhale and single inhale (2x exhale, 1x inhale time)
	- triangle breathing techinque, 
	- 4 sec inhale -- brace -- 4 sec exhale..
	- The dip in energy after 3-4 hours of work out is due to the adrenaline build up during the work out is not ramped down. MUST have a cooldown section followed by mindfulness breath or meditation. Looks odd in the gym but definately worth the time.

4. *How to build the endurance?*
	- Try to include exercises that are more concentric than eccentric, like cycling, rowing, pushing sledge, swiming. the eccentric exercise include running, which could lead to more sore. 
	- Try to get atleast zone 2 cardio of 150- 180 minutes every week
	- 30 - 90 sec of max heart rate for 2 - 3 times in a session for alteast once a week.
