## ElonMusk LexFriedman
I came accross this podcast when i am just browsing the youtube for some triathleon guy to get some tips on Swimming. First it was the Huberman video on NSDR, mindstates transistions.

Any way Now i am greatful about watching the whole video which is two and a half hour long. These are the key points are take away that i wrote them after one day.


### Key points
- Just do it even in the face of struggle.
- Money is just the database of resource allocation.
- History teaches you both good and bad.
- Plutonic ideal in any process to matches the progress.
- The first principle concept 
	- Basics
	- Energy conservation
	- Build axioms that are true from the ground up
- Brain is an advanced computer which deletes the unused.
- MSG: Just read a lot, Reading is super important, Get a broad General Knowledge on the range of subjects to find the passion. To strat with the encyclopedia britanica with some skipping on uninterested topics and some skimming involved.
- Become useful, give more than you consume. Help in your way to the better ment of society.


### Description
1. The reason to keep on doing even in the face of struggle is the fundamental thing in the process of growth. His says You do it or You perish, You choose.
2. Money is of no value if your are in an island with a trillan dollar you cannot buy anything. Money is not the ultimate goal it should be ONE of the goals.
3. he likes history, part of my understanding is that he is facinated by how it teaches us both good and bad. how and why did they needed to do it in the first place. You could hear to Dan Carlins history podcast
4. Musk says most of the do things the knowledege, methods and processes that they know, but it is not the right way. Always have a plutonic ideal of a process or Technology, then try to allign the atoms to that ideal. Try to be as close as possible to the ideal.
5. He is from the physics background, so everything can be broken down to the first principles and build them from the ground up. For excample the weight problem that he had with the starship he is building. Their are these elements with there consistuent mass and can decide on the what to put and what not to (?). Try to do some research on this first principles. He even talks about the Law of conservation of moment in the process of understanding with First Principles.
6. I am these thinking that my brain is having some problems recalling the names or places with some early stages of brain problems but the fact is it is very advanced system and the fact that the memory is very expensive. The brain deletes the things that are not important. It makes them in to archieves, which can be pulled out later.
7.
