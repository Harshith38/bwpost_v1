## Learning Fem from the basics
- There are a lot of useful resources on the Fenics project website https://fenicsproject.org/documentation/, both for learning finite element
methods with codes in Python and c++. If you have some good grasp on advanced c++ concepts including name spaces, data structures, classes and polymorphisms
then the inverse learning using the fenics demos in developer version is a good point to start. Otherwise, you can learn more about the c++ and code your
hand written algorithms for simple domains and problems. You may find c++ tutorials on http://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ useful. Another good source is
Numerical recipes in C++ http://www.nrbook.com/cpppages/chap0sel.pdf. It has a lot of code examples for a lot of computational mathematics tools like FFT,
linear and nonlinear root finding algorithms, interpolation and extrapolation codes etc, that you will need to code your FEM solver manually. It does have
some examples for PDEs too, this book heavily focus on finite difference methods and little in the finite element or spectral methods.
