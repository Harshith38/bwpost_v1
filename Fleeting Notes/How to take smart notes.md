# How to take smart notes

## **Multitasking is not a good idea**
Writing is not just typing with a keyboard in to the computer but instead it means reading, comprehensing the papers, understanding the ideas, getting ideas, comparing thoughts, making connections, and finding the right words, structuring, editing, and rewriting.


### 9.3 Give Each task the right kind of Attention
accepting criticism is constructive only when all the writing is done, not when the your are forming the idea in the first stages of writing. let the ideas flow, dont critic here, when you are doing the writing then you can start to critic on the passage upon the wording, ideas, use of structure etc., Get your thoughts on the paper first.

Dont makes plans to write, which is equivalent to driving on rails, you cannot change the directions flexibliy. This makes you rigid in terms of organisation. 

### **9.4 Become an expert**: 
Making plans is like a linear, multistep approach, which is never realistic in the first place, on the contrary being flexible is what essential in acedemic wirting which requuires lot of cognition decision making. we never know when that breakthrough idea could come in. It is like an art, something that only gets better with practice.

The author states that asking your teaching adivce on writing is not the best option, like the paramedics example, where the teaches knowledege could get you 3 out of 5 score where as the expert has a 4 or maybe 5, but to get that level you need to have that teeachers knowledge. which then builds up the intution. 
The feedback loop are the reason that makes the expert.

### **9.5 Get Closure:**
The short term [[memory]] can store store less than seven things temorarely. However, linking them to previous memory or understanding it can make the process much simpler. Things we understand are often are connected, through *theories, rules, narratives, mental models and Logic*

Facts that donot have a meaning or understood cannot hold in memory just like the memorising task in the example on rule and year. So asking [[better questions]] like could not only incearese our understanding but also facilitate our learning:
1. How does this fact fit into my idea of...?
2. How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? 
3. Are these two ideas complement or contradict each other?
4. isn't this arguement is similar to that one?
5. Haven't i heard this before?
6. And above all: What does x mean for y?

*Zeigarnik effect*: Open tasks tend to take up the short term memory, so write them now, because our brain doesn't distinguish between an actal finished task and one postponed by taking a note. This could be one of the reason why keeping a [[journal]] is effective. 
Hence we can ruminate only on the things or thoughts that need our attention on solving problem in a different way, not sitting at the desk thinking of the shopping list rather than on quality ideas.

> The secert to have a "mind like water" is to get all the little stuff out of our short term [[memory]].
> And we can't take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do this is to have a reliable system where we can store all our nagging thoughts about the many things that we need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.
> --- Getting things done

### **9.6 Reduce the number of Decisions:**
Apart from distractions, and less short term memory storage, Willpower is important as well, because it is a depreciable commodity. 

A techique called "ruse", is what makes us move the project move forward, instead of pushing ourselves in doing the thing we dont want to do. The technique is under intense scrutiny (Carter and McCullough 2014; Engber and Cauterucci 2016; Job, Dweck and Walton 2010), *A reliable and standard working environment is less taxing to our attention, concentration and willpower, or, if you like ego.* For instance, Bill gates and Obama wears only two types of suits to save it for one extra decision for more important ones.

Similarly, we organise our research and writing, we too can reduce alot of decisions. While content-related decision (on what is more and less important, connections between notes, the structure of text, etc.,) most organisational decisions can be made up front once and for all, by inducing a system:-
always,
1. same notebook for making quick notes,
2. extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way,
3. turning them in to the same kind of permanent notes, which we always dealt in the same manner,


## 10. Reading for Understanding

Primary step in generating new idea is reading as many articles as possible and understanding them by translating their work in to something like materialised slip box, this is the receipe. In the process, it could help in shaping our mental models and agruments or the other way around as well.
==**The goal is not to copy but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts that we read**==
the reason for that is, the idea that is presented in the article is specific for a particular context, and support a specific argument, but we need to translate it in to our own words is because we need to use it for new context and arguement of our own thinking. Avoiding pathwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.
*Translating:-* it means using differnt words to give it a truest possibel account of the original work.
