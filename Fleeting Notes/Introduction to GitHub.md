# Introduction to GitHub
I found GitHub is only for the software developers whixh it is. It is a very helpful tool in managing versions of the softwares. You could just push the software directly from the PC on to the Git using some commands..

The web site has an introduction to it, but it may be a bit old i guess, espcially while pushing the code to the hub it uses a username and password instead a autorisation key which you can create on the website itself. just paste it in the userid and just press enter for password.

The commands i used.
Echo "your text here" >>Readme.md
adding Your text here into the readme.md file
add the readme.md to git 
git commit "Comment"
git -m push Readme.md
