7. I have been observing your company for many months as i find your software products to be innovative and futhur oriented, i am convinced that i am fit for this role. that is why i am happy to exchange my ideas with you today. 



Introduction:

I am Sai Harshith Malka, I am currently masters in Computational Mechanics at Universität Duisburg Essen. Since from an early age I like mechanics and Automobiles I studied mechanical engineering as my Bachleors in India. After my bachleor thesis i found really facinating how the computer softwares are used in solving and designing. So I chose Computational mechanics as my masters studies. Here i am learning how computer software and mathematical models are combined to solve the engineering problems.

## CV 
**AoS :**  The Task is to automate all the process from the sketching to 
Using Macro recorder in Abaqus we could generate a python script for the changes we make in GUI of Abaqus, 

**CLFE** : This project also uses object oriented programming in C++, I have implemented a new class for the Given girder using TWA to calculate the section values like MoI **(trägheitsmoment)*, area (*Flächen des combined Profile*), Center of gravity. 

**SD :**  the task is to do idealisation of the two storied building and find the mode shapes and natural frequencies. And without idealisation, i analysed the structure for a 


## Questions
1. Is the thermal management for the batteries in specific or computers on the car or overall--- battery, E-drive, E-Axle, inverter, other power electronics ---- Battery cooliing,
2. In design of **passenger comfort**, is it using Air conditioning? or something else? Or even advanced like tracking passenger metrics like thermal stress or heartbeat and ADAPT air circulation?  or pre conditioning the cabin
