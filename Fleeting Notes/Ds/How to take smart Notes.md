### The Four underlying Principles

THe fleeting Notes is temporary and is of no use after one or two days of adding them unless they are linked with the other ideas and most importantly reflexted upon. Examples like, notes taken on the margins, underlines, notes taken while lecture or conversations, anything which does not interrupt the activity we are doing is a fleeting notes.  Permanent notes on the other hand, are written in such a that are understood even if we forget the context they are taken from. The last type of notes is the project notes that is made specific with the project and end up in archives after it is done.

Elaboration is key, most ideas dont stand for the article but some do, the threshold to take an idea should be very low, if the elaboration is not done is the indication of boring(banal) or not able to understand the idea.

The more note taking is not the idea because it decreases the retrival time instead it should be made more playfully. 

When you close the current project at the end of the evening you should not see anything but a pen and paper on the desk then you made a clear difference between the Fleeting notes, Permanent notes and Project related notes.

### 7. Nobody ever starts from Scratch. 
Writing can never linear, which is Plan your topic, do research, write,. THis is an Ideal plan lets be Realistic. Desciding a topic doesnot come out of thin air, one should have read considerable amount and descision to read is rooted in prior understanding as well. 

By keeping track of the topics that are interesting to you, question and arguements will emerge from the material without force. 

Develop your thinking through writing, is best skill.!! 
The people with this skill can focus on the topics they are interested in and start taking notes this leads to a cluster of notes at some point they may find that the interested topic makes no sence then they make an insight to shift other topic because of the insight. They make informed decisions reading, thinking and writing. This structured way is paramount.

### 8. Let the Work carry you forward.
The myth about the reward yourself after a struggling act could motivate you to do it again is actually FALSE. A study done by a fitness coach Seger, 2015 concludes that the participants that are allowed to reward themselves after an exercise with some hours of relaxation on sofa to watch TV, made them to quietly sip in to the sofa skipping the exercise altogether. Any attempts to trick ourself with rewards is not an efficient way to build an positve feedback loop. Only if we find the work itself rewarding then we have self-sutained positive feedback loop(DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).
Feedback loop is essential if we want to learn anything, avoiding it could be good for short term but will definately leaves us behind from other with it. Thinking that avoiding the feedback could break our positive mindset is not atlot all a good strategy. other reasons why someone could avoid are PRAISE, from childhood I was been Praised that I am a good student with good grasp and understanding in order to keep that praise, I stopped asking question or seeking advise thinking that hurt my Image in people or teachers. What could be done, The personal change that I want to improve no matter what(Change for the better) is the INWARDLY reward, getting pleasure from Praise is OUTWARDLY reward. The inwardly reward is a self sustained model for motivations and drive. The phobia for fear of Failure is "Kakorrhaphiophobia". 

In writing this circular approach could improve your work, while your are working right now, dynamic improvements
